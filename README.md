üéÆ Excited to share my latest project: A classic Snake Game built with Python! üêç

Diving into the world of programming, I‚Äôve developed a nostalgic Snake Game that many of us loved during our childhood. This project was a fun way to sharpen my Python skills and get creative with problem-solving.

Key features:

Smooth gameplay and responsive controls
Score tracking and high-score memory
Customizable game speed and snake color
This game not only brought back memories but also provided a hands-on experience with Python‚Äôs capabilities. It‚Äôs amazing how a simple game can teach so much about algorithms and software design!

Check out the game and let me know your thoughts. Your feedback is invaluable!
